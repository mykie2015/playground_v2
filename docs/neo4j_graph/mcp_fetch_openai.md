clasBased on my research, I'll now provide an explanation of how the code works and the setup you'll need to use it effectively.
Using OpenAI MCP API with Fetch Service
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open protocol that standardizes how applications provide context to LLMs, similar to how USB-C provides a standardized way to connect devices to various peripherals Openai. I've created two code examples that demonstrate how to use the OpenAI-compatible MCP API with the fetch MCP service to grab content from weblinks.
What is MCP?
MCP serves as a bridge between AI models and external services, creating a standardized communication framework that enhances tool integration, accessibility, and AI reasoning capabilities Substack. The fetch MCP service specifically allows AI models to retrieve content from weblinks.
Prerequisites
Before running either of the code examples, you'll need to:

Install the required packages:
bashpip install mcp-openai

Install the fetch MCP server:
bashpip install mcp-server-fetch

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:
bashexport OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"


Code Explanation
The first artifact provides a basic implementation while the second offers a more detailed version with error handling and a reusable class structure.
How the Code Works:

MCP Client Configuration: We set up an MCP client configuration with the fetch server, which allows us to connect to the MCP fetch service GitHub.
LLM Client Configuration: We configure the OpenAI-compatible client with your API key and base URL.
Request Configuration: We specify which model to use for the request (e.g., GPT-4o).
Connection: We establish a connection to the fetch MCP server.
Message Processing: We submit a conversation that includes instructions to fetch and process content from a specific URL.

Alternative Approach Using OpenAI Agents SDK
The first artifact also includes an alternative implementation using the OpenAI Agents SDK with MCP support:
With this approach, you would create an agent with access to the fetch MCP server and then run it with a request to fetch web content GitHub. This requires a configuration file (mcp_agent.config.yaml) to define the MCP servers.
Important Notes:

The MCP architecture consists of an MCP Host (the AI model), an MCP Client (intermediary service), and MCP Servers (lightweight applications that expose specific capabilities) Microsoft.
The uvx command used in the examples is from uv, a Python package installer and environment manager. If you don't have it installed, you can use npx or other appropriate commands depending on your setup.
Ensure you have properly set up your API key and have access to the appropriate OpenAI model.
While MCP is promising, it's worth noting that not all AI platforms or models support MCP out-of-the-box yet Substack.

The second artifact provides a more robust implementation with a reusable WebContentFetcher class that handles initialization, URL processing, and proper cleanup of resources. It also demonstrates how to extract specific information from webpages.

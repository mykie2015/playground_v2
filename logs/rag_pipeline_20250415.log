    reasoning="Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. It is designed for integer factorization, which means it can efficiently find the prime factors of a composite number. This is significant because the security of many cryptographic systems, such as RSA, relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. Shor's Algorithm operates in polynomial time, making it exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms for this problem, which run in sub-exponential time. The algorithm utilizes quantum computing principles, including superposition and entanglement, to achieve its efficiency.",

    reasoning="Shor's Algorithm is a quantum algorithm developed by mathematician Peter Shor in 1994. It is designed for integer factorization, which means it can efficiently find the prime factors of a composite number. This is significant because the security of many cryptographic systems, such as RSA, relies on the difficulty of factoring large integers. Shor's Algorithm operates in polynomial time, making it exponentially faster than the best-known classical algorithms for this problem, which run in sub-exponential time. The algorithm utilizes quantum computing principles, specifically quantum superposition and entanglement, to achieve its efficiency.",

2025-04-15 05:45:22,209 | DEBUG    | rag_pipeline | rag_pipeline.py:162 | Generated answer: The key differences between DSPy RAG and traditional RAG approaches likely include the following aspects: 
1. **Modularity**: DSPy RAG is built on a framework that allows for composable units (modules) that can be chained together, promoting a more modular design compared to traditional RAG, which may not emphasize this level of modularity.
2. **Type Safety**: DSPy utilizes a signature system that defines expected inputs and outputs, making the interface explicit and type-safe, which is not a standard feature in traditional RAG approaches.
3. **Separation of Concerns**: DSPy separates model prompting from execution, enabling systematic prompt development and optimization, whereas traditional RAG may integrate these processes more closely, potentially leading to less flexibility in prompt management.

Overall, DSPy RAG appears to offer a more structured and systematic approach to working with language models compared to traditional RAG methods.

    reasoning='The provided context does not contain specific information about DSPy RAG or traditional RAG approaches. However, it does mention that DSPy is a framework for programming with language models that separates model prompting from execution, which may imply a more structured and systematic approach compared to traditional RAG methods. Traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) typically combines retrieval and generation in a less modular way. Without explicit details on DSPy RAG, I can infer that the key differences might lie in the modularity, type safety, and systematic prompt development that DSPy offers compared to the more integrated and possibly less structured traditional RAG.',
